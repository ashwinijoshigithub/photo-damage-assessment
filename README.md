Estimate damage associated with a vehicle using deep learning

## Background
Whenever an accident happens and damage occurs, client reports the incident and requests for compensation of the damage to the insurance company. The claim is then assigned to a claim adjuster who investigates the circumstances and works on getting the claim settled by repairing the vehicle. </br>
Car insurance industry suffers huge losses in the process due to claim leakage. Claims leakage is  the money lost through failures within existing processes, including inefficient claim processing, human error or fraud. The ability to monitor and mitigate leakage during the early stages of claims processing is key to an insurance companyâ€™s profitability. </br>
It would be easier if they had a point of reference for the damage cost which would be useful to further negotiate with the client. Visual inspection and validation have been used to reduce such effects. However, they introduce delays in the claim processing and requires human expertise. So, an automated system for the car insurance claim processing is a need of the hour. 
Deep learning has played an important role in building such automated systems. But it is a complex task which involves locating damaged parts, identifying type and severity of the damage, what kind of repair is needed and how much it may cost. So, this field still has a broad scope  and presents a great opportunity for researchers for exploring trending image processing techniques to deliver accurate estimation.
